  // Irritatingly, Chrome doesn't support "browser_specific_settings" and
  // Mozilla requires it for using the API to upload new extension versions.
  // Fortunately, the only effect of this seems to be that Chrome complains, but
  // the extension still loads (at least for loading unpacked). May need to get
  // creative with other options if actually publishing a Chrome extension.
